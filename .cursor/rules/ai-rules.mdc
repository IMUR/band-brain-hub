# Cursor AI Coding Rules

## Core Principles

- Always implement the simplest possible solution
- Maintain code cleanliness and organization
- Focus solely on the requested changes
- Use established patterns unless explicitly directed otherwise

## Code Quality Standards

- Maximum file length: 200-300 lines
- No code duplication
- No stubbing or mock data in dev/prod environments
- No modification of .env files
- Prefer end-to-end testing
- Fix failing tests while ensuring changes don't impact other environments

## Development Workflow

- Make small, focused changes
- Commit after each change
- Test frequently
- Stay within the scope of the request
- Consider impacts on related code areas
- Use existing implementations before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when replacing them

## File Management

- Avoid creating new files/scripts unless necessary
- Delete temporary test scripts after use
- Keep related functionality grouped together

## Technology Guidelines

- Maintain separate databases for dev/test/prod
- Follow the project's specified technical stack

## Change Management

- Only make well-understood changes
- Don't modify unrelated code
- Preserve working architectural patterns unless instructed
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new ones
- Remove deprecated code after implementing replacements
