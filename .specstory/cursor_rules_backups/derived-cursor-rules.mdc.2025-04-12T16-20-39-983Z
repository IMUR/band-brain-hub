## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Band Brain Hub is a single-page, mobile-critical web application designed for band members to collaboratively manage events, tasks, notes, finances, and setlists. The application prioritizes rapid deployment, excellent UX/UI, and seamless real-time synchronization. Offline support is crucial. The application is now implemented as a single-file application using Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, leveraging IndexedDB for persistence.  Authentication is already implemented.

## CODE STYLE
Consistent with standard Svelte/TypeScript best practices. Emphasis on readability and maintainability.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
N/A - Single file application (using a build tool like Vite for development).

## TECH STACK
Svelte 5, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, uuid, IndexedDB, Vite (build tool)

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- All data is persisted locally using IndexedDB.
- The application is designed as a single-file application for ease of deployment and maintenance (using Vite for development).
- UI should be intuitive for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- The application should maintain a conversational tone in interactions with users.
- Reactive, real-time updates are implemented using Svelte 5 runes.
- Offline support is provided through IndexedDB integration.


## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
Rapid iterative development and deployment cycles. Prioritize features based on user needs and feedback.

## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
N/A - Single file application.


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
All documentation is embedded within the `app.js` file (post-build) through comments and type definitions.

## DEBUGGING
Standard browser developer tools.
